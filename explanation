Great to hear that it's working! Now, let’s break down the key concepts involved in your Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, especially regularization, misclassification, and how they all work together to find the optimal decision boundary.
1. Goal of SVM

The primary objective of an SVM is to find the best hyperplane (or decision boundary) that separates two classes (positive and negative) in a dataset. The SVM algorithm tries to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class. These closest points are called support vectors.
2. Misclassification

Misclassification occurs when a data point is on the wrong side of the hyperplane, i.e., when it is incorrectly predicted. In an ideal world, all data points would be correctly classified by the hyperplane, but in practice, it's often impossible to separate them perfectly.

In the case of SVM:

    If a data point is correctly classified (i.e., it lies on the correct side of the margin), the model doesn't change the hyperplane much.
    If a data point is misclassified (i.e., it lies on the wrong side of the margin), the model will adjust the hyperplane in an attempt to make it correctly classified.

The SVM learns by adjusting the weights (for the features) and the bias (which shifts the hyperplane) to reduce misclassification.
3. How SVM Works (Update Rule)

The model adjusts its weights and bias based on whether the points are correctly classified or misclassified:

    Condition for Correct Classification: The condition for correct classification is determined by:
    label[i]⋅(dot product of sample[i]−bias)≥1
    label[i]⋅(dot product of sample[i]−bias)≥1
        If this is True, the sample is correctly classified (i.e., it's on the correct side of the hyperplane and also at least 1 unit away from the hyperplane).
        If this is False, the sample is misclassified, and we need to adjust the model.

    Weight Update for Correct Classification: When the sample is correctly classified, the algorithm applies a regularization step (explained below) to prevent overfitting and ensure the weights stay small. This is done by shrinking the weights slightly using:
    weight[i]=weight[i]−learning rate×(2×λ×weight[i])
    weight[i]=weight[i]−learning rate×(2×λ×weight[i])

    This helps keep the model general and avoids overfitting to the training data.

    Weight Update for Misclassification: When a sample is misclassified, the model corrects the weights to bring the hyperplane closer to that point. The update is based on:
    weight[i]=weight[i]−learning rate×(2×λ×weight[i]−label[i]×sample[i])
    weight[i]=weight[i]−learning rate×(2×λ×weight[i]−label[i]×sample[i])

    Here, the model adjusts the weight based on both the feature values and the label (to push the point in the correct direction). Additionally, the bias is updated by:
    bias=bias−learning rate×label[i]
    bias=bias−learning rate×label[i]

    This helps shift the decision boundary to make it better classify the misclassified point.

4. Regularization

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting — which means making sure the model doesn't fit the training data too closely, which could result in poor generalization to new data.
In the context of SVM:

The regularization term is controlled by the parameter lambda (λ). The purpose of regularization is to penalize the weights and encourage the model to keep the weights as small as possible while still fitting the data. This helps the model generalize better and prevents it from overfitting.

    How regularization works: In the update rule, you can see that the weight update includes a term:
    2×λ×weight[i]
    2×λ×weight[i]

    This term shrinks the weights during training, making them smaller. When weights are small, the model is more likely to have a simpler decision boundary (hyperplane) rather than one that is overly complex and fits noise in the data.

    Lambda (λ):
        If λ is large, the model prioritizes minimizing the size of the weights over classifying all points correctly. This leads to simpler models that might underfit.
        If λ is small, the model focuses more on classifying the data points correctly, potentially leading to overfitting.

5. Bias Term

The bias (intercept) controls how the decision boundary (hyperplane) is shifted. It allows the SVM to create a decision boundary that isn't necessarily passing through the origin.

    In your implementation, the bias is updated when misclassification occurs:
    bias=bias−learning rate×label[i]
    bias=bias−learning rate×label[i] The bias shift helps the decision boundary better classify the misclassified point by moving the hyperplane.

6. Prediction

Once the model is trained (i.e., after enough iterations), you can use the learned weights and bias to make predictions for new data points. The prediction is done by computing the dot product between the sample and the weights, and subtracting the bias:
prediction=sign(dot product of sample and weights−bias)
prediction=sign(dot product of sample and weights−bias)

    If the result is positive, the model predicts the sample belongs to the positive class (1).
    If the result is negative, the model predicts the sample belongs to the negative class (-1).

7. How Does the Model "Learn"?

    Training: During the training phase, the SVM model adjusts the weights and bias in response to misclassified samples. It iteratively tries to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the two classes while penalizing large weights to prevent overfitting.
    Convergence: After a set number of iterations or when the model reaches a stopping condition, the SVM stops training and can be used for prediction on new data.

Conclusion

    Misclassification: Occurs when a data point is on the wrong side of the hyperplane. When this happens, the model adjusts the weights and bias to fix the error and better separate the classes.
    Regularization: Helps prevent the model from fitting the training data too perfectly (overfitting) by penalizing large weights, encouraging simpler and more general decision boundaries.
    Training: The SVM iteratively adjusts the weights and bias to minimize misclassification and find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the two classes.

By using these techniques, the SVM can create a robust model that works well not just on the training data but also on new, unseen data.
