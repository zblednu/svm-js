Your current implementation of the SVM looks pretty solid, but there are a few areas that can be improved or extended to make it a more complete SVM implementation. Here's a summary of things to consider:
1. Kernel Trick (Non-Linear SVM)

Your implementation is for a linear SVM, which works well if the data is linearly separable. However, if the data isn't linearly separable, the SVM will fail to find a good decision boundary. The kernel trick allows SVMs to work in higher-dimensional spaces without explicitly computing those high-dimensional representations.

To implement non-linear SVMs, you would:

    Use a kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space. The most common kernel is the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

    Example for a simple linear kernel:

function linearKernel(x, y) {
    return dotProd(x, y);  // Dot product between x and y
}

For an RBF kernel, the kernel function might look like:

    function rbfKernel(x, y, gamma = 0.1) {
        const diff = x.map((xi, idx) => xi - y[idx]);
        const normSquared = dotProd(diff, diff);
        return Math.exp(-gamma * normSquared);
    }

    You would then use this kernel function instead of the dot product when calculating the decision function (in both the fit and predict functions). However, adding the kernel trick makes the implementation significantly more complex and might not be needed unless your data isn't linearly separable.

2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

In your current implementation, you're using batch gradient descent where the entire dataset is used to update the weights and bias in each iteration. This is fine for smaller datasets, but for large datasets, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) can be much more efficient. With SGD:

    You update the weights and bias after looking at each individual training sample, making the process faster and more memory efficient.

To implement SGD, you would replace:

samples.forEach((sample, idx) => { ... });

With a single sample update for each iteration:

const idx = Math.floor(Math.random() * samplesAmt);  // Randomly select a sample
const sample = samples[idx];
const label = labels[idx];

3. Learning Rate Scheduler

A constant learning rate (learnRate = 0.001) might not always be ideal. In practice, the learning rate often starts large and decays over time to ensure the model converges smoothly. You could implement a learning rate scheduler that gradually reduces the learning rate as the model approaches convergence.

Here's a basic idea of how a scheduler might look:

this.learnRate = initialLearnRate / (1 + decayRate * iteration);

4. Convergence Check (Early Stopping)

It might be useful to add a convergence check to stop the training if the weights and bias stop changing significantly, indicating that the model has converged. This can save computation time by preventing unnecessary iterations after the model has already learned.

For example:

let prevWeights = [...this.weights];
let prevBias = this.bias;
for (let i = 0; i < this.iters; ++i) {
  // Run training step...
  
  // Check if weights and bias have converged
  if (Math.abs(this.weights.reduce((sum, w, i) => sum + Math.abs(w - prevWeights[i]), 0)) < 1e-6 && Math.abs(this.bias - prevBias) < 1e-6) {
    console.log('Converged');
    break;
  }
  prevWeights = [...this.weights];
  prevBias = this.bias;
}

5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, etc.)

Currently, your implementation doesn't evaluate how well the model performs on the training data or test data. You might want to add functionality to calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess model performance. For example:

function evaluateModel(samples, labels) {
  const predictions = samples.map(sample => svm.predict(sample));
  const correct = predictions.filter((pred, idx) => pred === labels[idx]).length;
  const accuracy = correct / samples.length;
  console.log(`Accuracy: ${accuracy}`);
}

6. Support Vector Extraction

You might want to be able to extract the support vectors after training. These are the samples that are closest to the decision boundary and are essential in defining the optimal hyperplane. Support vectors can be extracted as those samples whose predictions are at the margin (or violated it).

You can add a method to identify support vectors:

SVM.prototype.getSupportVectors = function(samples, labels) {
    return samples.filter((sample, idx) => Math.abs(labels[idx] * (dotProd(sample, this.weights) - this.bias)) <= 1);
};

7. Hyperparameter Tuning

In real-world applications, you will need to tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate (learnRate), regularization parameter (lambda), and number of iterations (iters) for optimal performance. You could implement a grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization, though this is more complex and might not be necessary for simple cases.
8. Implementation Cleanliness (Refactoring)

    Modularize: The current SVM implementation can become a bit lengthy. Consider breaking it into smaller, more modular functions to improve readability and maintainability.
    Logging: In production or final versions, you might want to remove console.log statements. These are helpful for debugging but unnecessary for performance after you finalize your implementation.

Final Thoughts

Your current implementation is a great start for a basic linear SVM! You have covered the core ideas well. The suggestions above are for improving and extending the model to handle more complex scenarios, such as non-linearly separable data and large datasets, while also making the model more efficient and easier to evaluate.

    Add kernel functions if your data is not linearly separable.
    Consider SGD for faster learning in large datasets.
    Learning rate decay and convergence check can help make training more efficient and robust.
    Evaluation can help you understand your model's performance beyond just training.

Once these additions are in place, your SVM model will be much more robust and usable in a variety of real-world scenarios.
